# Picasso 

Picasso is a diffusion model designed to generate landscape paintings. Leveraging state-of-the-art machine learning techniques, Picasso transforms random noise into coherent images of landscapes through a progressive denoising process. 

## Project Overview

The primary goal of Picasso is to generate landscape paintings, offering numerous applications in art and content creation. Although the model is specifically trained on Impressionist landscape paintings, it can be easily retrained on various datasets to replicate their styles in generated images.
